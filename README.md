## Hello There!

Iâ€™m Ian, a backend engineer who loves building tools that make life easier for other developers. Iâ€™m passionate about
clean architecture, developer experience, and creating performant, reliable systems. Most of my work lives behind the
scenesâ€”but thatâ€™s where I think the real magic happens.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me hiking/biking around the Bay Area with Nurture by Porter Robinson in my ears,
playing strategy games like chess and Magic, or cooking Italian food.
